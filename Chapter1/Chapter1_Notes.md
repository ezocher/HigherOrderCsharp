# Chapter 1 Notes

## Section 1.6 - Functional versus object-oriented programming
There is no code in section 1.6, but the book describes an analogous object-oriented approach to implementing dir_walk in C++ using an abstract base class and and two virtual methods.

I have followed this description and built it in C# in the Chapter1_6 project.
